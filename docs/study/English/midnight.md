# Midnights 专辑歌词

## Maroon

When the morning came we
清晨洒下第一缕阳光

When cleaning incense off your
你黑胶搁架上的焚香，逐渐被我们扫至一尘不染

vinyl shelf' cause we lost track of time again
而那时你我已再度丧失时间观念

Laughing with my feet in your lap
脚踩你腿上，我大笑不止

Like you were my cloest friend
就如同 你为我至亲挚友

“How'd we end up on the floor anyway?”
“为何我们还是在地板上睡着了？”

You say,“Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top Rose, that's how.”
你说：“还不是因为你的室友的旋盖红酒如此廉价低级”

I see you every day now.
所以如今我每日都能望见你的面庞。

And I chose you
可我选择了你

The one I was dancing with in New York
曾于纽约，共舞之人

No shoes, looked up
赤踝裸脚，抬头仰望

At the sky and it was
天空之景，却为

The burgundy on my t-shit when you splashed your wine into
你朝我泼出红葡，我半袖上便留下红色印痕

Me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks,so scarlet it was
而血液汇聚于我面肌，我的双颊如血液般鲜红

The mark they saw on my cillarbone the rust that grew between telephones
你在我锁骨上留下的痕，不再使用的座机锈迹斑斑

The lips I used to call home. So scarlet, it was maroon 
我曾呼唤归途的双唇如此鲜红，而一切却曾是褐红

When the silence came we
而我们闭口不谈

Were shaking blind and hazy
视线却一片模糊，朦胧不清

How the hell did we lose sight of us again
你我究竟如何？再度迷失了彼此

Sobbing with your head in your hands
你抱头痛哭

Ain't that the way shit always ends
好似一切终将完结

You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
你双眼空洞站在走廊

Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us.
你曾将康乃馨误认为玫瑰，那便为我们的模样

I feel you no matter what, the rubies that I gave up
无论如何，我都能够感知到你的存在，当我将你失去

And I lost you
我便不再拥有那宝石般的红

The one I was dancing with in New York
曾于纽约，共舞之人

No shoes, looked up
赤踝裸脚，抬头仰望

At the sky and it was（Maroon）
天空之景，却为（褐红）

The burgundy on my t-shit when you splashed your wine into
你朝我泼出红葡，我半袖上便留下红色印痕

Me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks,so scarlet it was
而血液汇聚于我面肌，我的双颊如血液般鲜红

The mark they saw on my cillarbone the rust that grew between telephones
你在我锁骨上留下的痕，不再使用的座机锈迹斑斑

The lips I used to call home. So scarlet, it was maroon 
我曾呼唤归途的双唇如此鲜红，而一切却曾是褐红

And I wake with your memory over me
辗转反侧，关于你的回忆，于我的脑海中挥之不去

That's a real fucking legacy, legacy
这就如同你寻得的一份遗产

And I wake with your memory over me
辗转反侧，关于你的回忆，于我的脑海中挥之不去

That's a real fucking legacy,……to leave
这就如同你寻得的一份遗产

The burgundy on my t-shit when you splashed your wine into
你朝我泼出红葡，我半袖上便留下红色印痕

Me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks,so scarlet it was
而血液汇聚于我面肌，我的双颊如血液般鲜红

The mark they saw on my cillarbone the rust that grew between telephones
你在我锁骨上留下的痕，不再使用的座机锈迹斑斑

The lips I used to call home. So scarlet, it was maroon 
我曾呼唤归途的双唇如此鲜红，而一切却曾是褐红

It was maroon 
一切皆为褐红

Meet me at Midnight
