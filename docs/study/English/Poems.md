## Sonnet 18   ——by Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer's leasse hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed,

And every fair from fair sometimes declines, 

By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,

Nor shall the Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,

When in eternal lines and time thou grow'st;

So long as men can breathe or eye can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

## No man is an island  ——John Donn

No man is an island, entire of itself;

every man is a piece of the continent,

a part of the main;

if a clod be washed away by the sea,

Europe is the less,

as well as if the promontory were,

as well as any manor of thy feiends or of thine own were;

any man's death diminishes me,

because I am involved in mankind.

And therefore never send to know,

for whom the bell tolls,

it tolls for thee.

## In a station of the Metro  ——Ezra Pound

The apparition of these faces in the crowd,

Petals on a wet, black bough.
