# 10.24 湛江湾海底隧道 Zhanjiang Bay undersea tunnel

近日，广湛高铁湛江湾海底隧道工程盾构机累计掘进进尺3000米，入海超1600米，标志着广湛高铁项目建设实现又一重要节点突破。

The China Railway Design Corp announced on Oct. 20 that its Tunnel Boring Machine has already dug a 3,000-meter section of the Zhanjiang Bay undersea tunnel, some 1,600 meters of which runs under the seabed, marking an important stage in the construction of the Guangzhou-Zhanjiang high-speed railway.

我们坚持创新引领，高铁、大飞机等装备制造实现重大突破，新能源汽车占全球总量一半以上，港珠澳大桥、北京大兴国际机场等超大型交通工程建成投运，交通成为中国现代化的开路先锋。

Convinced of the need for innovation, we have achieved major breakthroughs in equipment manufacturing like high-speed trains and large aircraft. We have more than half of the world's new energy vehicles. Mega transport projects like the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Beijing Daxing International Airport have been completed and put into operation. Transport has become a frontier in China's modernization drive.
