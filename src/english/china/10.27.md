A draft revision to the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women will be further reviewed during an upcoming session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, which is set to convene from Oct. 26 to 30. Under the draft, the human resources and social security departments are also allowed to work with trade unions or women federations to have regulatory talks with employers if companies are found to be having trouble guaranteeing women's labor rights and interests, Zang Tiewei, spokesman for the NPC Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission, said while introducing the draft's contents to media on Oct. 24.

We need to remove barriers and create an enabling environment in which women are motivated, their creativity is unleashed to the full, and they truly feel satisfied, happy and secure.
