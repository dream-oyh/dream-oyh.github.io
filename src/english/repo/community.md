## City

### Should we put roads underground?

-- for urban planners and engineers

A NEW THING: roads underground? How might underground roads **_reshape our cities_** or **_redefine the daily commute_**?

ADVANTAGES:

- pedestrianize the roads and revitalize the city center
  > **pedestrianize**: to moke an area into one where the vehicles are not allowed to go.
  >
  > **revitalize**: to give new life, energy and activities.
- free up space for more public amenities
  > **amenity**:sth. that is intended to make life more pleasant or comfortable for the people in the town, hotel or other space.
- reduce the traffic congestions / free from the sight of gridlocked traffic
- free from the air and the noise pollution
- self-driving cars become popular, which are more **_energy-efficient_**

DRAWBACKS / DISADVANTAGES:

- a hazardous and **_energy-intensive_** constructions and maintenance of underground infrastructure
  > **_hazardous_** = dangerous
- the sense of confinement affects public perceptions[^first].

[^first]: compared with "perception" in [the Growth block](growth.md)

REFLECTION:

Dream of roadless, car-less cities bring both excitement and skepticism. We may fantasize about cityscape made for more pedestrians, but perhaps getting more people to use public transport rather than private vehicles would be more worth our time and resources.

## Environment

### Is always plastic bad?

Cotton or plastic: which kind of bag is better for the environment?

CURRENT SITUATIONS:

- The plastic is used in quantities and often _disposed of_ after a single use.
  > _disposed of_: to get rid of sth
- Producing plastic can cause toxins to be released in the atmosphere.
- Thrown-away plastic can sit _in landfill sites_ for centuries, or alternatively can _contaminate_ the sea causing harm to wildlife and breaking down into polluting microplastics.
  > _landfill sites_ 垃圾填埋站
  >
  > _contaminate_: to make sth. less pure or make it poisonous.

DRAWBACK OF COTTONS and ADVANTAGES OF PLASTIC:

- As the bags are heavier, transporting them will lead to higher **carbon emission**.
- Lightweight plastic components in cars and planes help **reduce the fuel use and emissions**.
- If we didn't use so much plastic in clothing and footwear, the amount of land, water and chemicals that would be needed to produce enough natural textiles or leather would be enormous.
