### Should we put roads underground?

-- for urban planners and engineers

A NEW THING: roads underground? How might underground roads **_reshape our cities_** or **_redefine the daily commute_**?

ADVANTAGES:

- pedestrianize the roads and revitalize the city center
  > **pedestrianize**: to moke an area into one where the vehicles are not allowed to go.
  >
  > **revitalize**:to give new life, energy and activities.
- free up space for more public amenities
  > **amenity**:sth. that is intended to make life more pleasant or comfortable for the people in the town, hotel or other space.
- reduce the traffic congestions / free from the sight of gridlocked traffic
- free from the air and the noise pollution
- self-driving cars become popular, which are more **_energy-efficient_**

DRAWBACKS / DISADVANTAGES:

- a hazardous and **_energy-intensive_** constructions and maintenance of underground infrastructure
  > **_hazardous_** = dangerous
- the sense of confinement affects public perceptions[^1].

REFLECTION:

Dream of roadless, car-less cities bring both excitement and skepticism. We may fantasize about cityscape made for more pedestrians, but perhaps getting more people to use public transport rather than private vehicles would be more worth our time and resources.
