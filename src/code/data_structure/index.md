# Data structure

For the summer camp of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I decided to learn data structure to prepare for the oncoming exam.

From 2024/06/20 to 2024/06/22, I spent three days to learn it simply, and challenge myself to learn it in English. Surprsingly, I did it!

My learning source is [the class from bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fv4y1f7T1). 9 hours of lesson can get started in the data structure quickly. It's enough for exam (maybe). Because of I major in the transportation equipment, the data structure is not my major lesson. So I don't know how difficult the exam is. But I think, for some simple application, I can use suitable data structure to achieve something at least.

Moreover, I advise you write code after each lesson by yourself. Reproduction of code is a good and efficient way to enhance your code ability. Don't hesitate, just do it~ Contents below is my note during my learning, recorded in English. If you are interested in it, welcome to come for my job.
